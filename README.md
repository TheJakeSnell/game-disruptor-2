# Game Disruptor 2
The Game Disruptor 2.0 is a prototype designed to allow fully automated exploration of game variables across two balance objectives.
The tool was designed to be game-independent with a json-based inter-process communication (IPC) allowing for any game to be modified to interface with the tool. This approach was taken so that new games could be supported without needing to make changes to the Game Disruptor tool itself.

The pre-built version of the prototype comes with two games already set-up ready to balance, MicroRTS framework and the Disaster at Joadia Islands wargame.
